            Not really. I just left the office. So I was just driving. My wife had a nail in her tire or something. So I got to go meet her at the tire store one of those days but nothing too bad.

            Yeah… it's kinda the same. We did. We saw the Sage.

            Intact stuff which I like it is kind of expensive. 
        </p>

            So, I, I'll be honest, I think right now we're leaning towards BuildOps for our field management because with us being pretty heavy Construction, they had a, they had a nice Construction management project and then they're… their service dispatch, I think is pretty more than adequate for what we need. And then I'm just contemplating whether to switch to go with stick with Quickbooks online for ERP or make a move to Sage intact? 
        </p>

            Yeah. So, yeah, I just wanna be able to like provide a quoted price to them. So like I, I'm not saying like service tighten, for instance, you can load your catalog in there and I can say replace ceiling, you know, like a tech can go in, replace ceiling fan and automatically pulls a price out of a flat rate catalog. And it says, okay, replace ceiling fan, 250 bucks. I'm not necessarily looking for that. I'm looking for. 
        </p>

            You know… because of the fact that we're gonna be doing quite a bit of residential work… mixed in with commercial work and I wanna be able to provide a customer with a quote whether it be a TM or like a, just a quoted price. And I don't know saying I have to pull it out of a flat rate catalog, but I would like to be able to say replace seal fan and he could type in 300 bucks, you know, and then provide that to the customer on the spot as a.

            As a, as a quoted price, do the work and then provide an invoice to the customer on the spot too.

            You can. Okay. Well, and like I've said, I mean, I have 100 percent made up my mind.

            We've kinda got a bunch of stuff sitting on that we're going through. I mean, we just finished up like kind of the Sage stuff actually this morning. So I hadn't even had a chance, like we kinda got that. Now we're like, okay, let's figure out kind of the direction we wanna go and I like, I liked your product. I think the only thing that BuildOps kinda had for our particular… was the fact that we could use BuildOps for the project management side and the service side too. 
        </p>
</div>

<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=306.36" target="_blank">5:06 </a>	
            Which, you know, is important for us since we're you know, right now, we're really heavy new Construction and growing our service business. So we still have to manage that part of our business. 
        </p>
</div>

<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=333.33" target="_blank">5:33 </a>	
            I'd have to go back through my notes, you know, having seen… service tighten, I saw a couple of weeks ago, but seeing service trade, BuildOps and then Sage with their, we looked at their. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=349.41" target="_blank">5:49 </a>	
            Their, their field management stuff too. I wasn't too impressed with that. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=354.92" target="_blank">5:54 </a>	
            And it all kinda runs together but I have my notes. I have my notes back… in my computer bag here. So I'd have to kinda go back through, but no, I thought overall. 
        </p>
</div>

<div class="monologue">

<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=368.38" target="_blank">6:08 </a>	
            The only, you know, the only thing I thought on yours was if I was doing totally commercial work or vast majority commercial service work, I think you guys would have the best product. I think for us. It's just looking at our, of business and telling that we're still gonna do some Construction projects. And I kinda see just. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=392.82" target="_blank">6:32 </a>	
            From our folks who we have on staff in the service that we're probably like commercial, which we're probably also gonna target the residential market too. I just think that's kinda, and so just kinda looking at the products that best, you know, suit that because the customer experience is obviously different for your typical residential and versus commercial, what kind of how you have to present it to the customers? And, you know, we want to be able to put ourselves in a position to invoice and collect payment on site as we grow that residential. I think that's important that we're able to do that. 
        </p>

            Okay, fine. 
        </p>
</div>

<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=452.51" target="_blank">7:32 </a>	
            Yeah, yeah. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=472.35" target="_blank">7:52 </a>	
            Similar to you in… today, you'd have to kinda do a little bit of a work around. I mean, you can do all that. I'd be very similar to how yours is. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=486.18" target="_blank">8:06 </a>	
            And, but they are, they've got, they've actually got some releases with some this calendar year… that would. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=498.1" target="_blank">8:18 </a>	
            Pertain a little bit more to the residential side. So again, I know it's like something that's not there yet, but they say is coming is always you have to take that with a grain of salt. But they were pretty specific in what some other things they're working on that would address that with some. 
        </p>
</div>
<div class="monologue">
<p class="speaker">Jason</p>
<p class="text">
<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=517.27" target="_blank">8:37 </a>	
            You know, with a little bit more, I'll call it a little bit more like service tightened experience on the residential side. So… but if you took their package today, it would be similar like we could create a kind of like you said, just a total price and kinda create like a proposal for the customer with a quoted price and I could, they could invoice on site but it would require. 
        </p>

<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=554.15" target="_blank">9:14 </a>	
            It would, it would require a little bit of work for a technician and the technician would have to have an iPad which they're going to have anyway but they could do it, but I would say it's not nearly as seamless as what service tighten is. 
        </p>

<a class="timestamp" href="../call?id=5859311918891532244&amp;play=570.09" target="_blank">9:30 </a>	
            But we're not looking for just that. I mean, if it was just residential stuff that I would do, I'd probably bite the bullet and, you know, spend the money for service tighten, but I don't think that's exactly what we're looking for. And it does sound like they have some development in the works, it's gonna.
